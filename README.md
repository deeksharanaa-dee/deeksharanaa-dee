👋 Hi, I’m @deeksharanaa-dee

👀 I love making sense of data and building projects that help people understand the world through numbers.

🌱 Right now, I’m learning new tricks in Python and playing with cool data tools to turn messy info into clear stories.

💞️ I’m excited to team up on projects that make data fun and useful for everyone!

⚡ Fun fact: I once tracked my coffee habits for a year and learned I’m actually most productive after a good nap!
